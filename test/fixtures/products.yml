  title: CoffeeScript
  description: > 
                CoffeeScript is JavaScript done right. It provides all of JavaScript's 
                functionality wrapped in a cleaner, more succinct syntax. In the first 
                book on this exciting new language, CoffeeScript guru Trevor Burnham 
                shows you how to hold onto all the power and flexibility of JavaScript 
                while writing clearer, cleaner, and safer code.
